# Lab 8 - Starter

1. I would fit the automated tests within a Github Action that runs whenever new code is pushed to the repo. This is preferrable because it runs automatically whenever the repo is updated without having to run the tests manually before committing.
2. I would not run end to end testing because it is not appropriate for validating the output of a function. End to end testing simulates a user experience, and many functions are not interacted with by users directly, or they do not get to see the output directly.
